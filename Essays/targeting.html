    <h1>Targeting the Inner Child</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Advertising and gambling uniquely prey upon the most 'childish' element of our psyche. This essay seeks to explore this connection between advertising, gambling, games and the 'inner child'.

    <h2>The Inner Child</h2>

        <h3>Images and Their Place in the Psyche</h3>
        <p>I would contend that nearly every person has certain elements present in their psyche. It is hard to say where these elements may evolve from. We all create "images" of every person we know; these "images" are our perception of their "self". Often, these images may be distorted, inaccurate, overembelished, etc. One can also have an "image" of their own self and personality. These "images", however unreliable, serve as our own internal guide into the personality of the other person. Take for example, the impression of a wonderful teacher. This person, through their best effort and practice, has passed on some element of their judgement and values that they expressed towards the student. That is to say that, all while it may be possible, that "image" of the teacher may be wholly inaccurate to their actual self, however the image persists within the mind as-is.</p>
        <p>The strength of these images increases with one's knowledge of a person. For example, the image of my best friend within my mind may show me how he would react to a certain situation, decide to eat a particular food, get angry from a certain insult, frustrated from a game, etc. It seems almost that these images serve as a sort of "model" through which we can run certain ideas, concepts, and thoughts. For example, think of a person close to you and consider: "if I was wholly desperate and without choice, how would I persuade this person to give me a large sum of money?". Upon consideration, one may find they have several ideas as to how one would pose the question (given the person), how the person may react, how one may respond, etc.</p>

        <h3>The Division of the Psyche</h3>
        <p>People often describe having a "part" of themselves which resembles their mother, or at least her better traits. These elements could be said to have a specific style of thinking and analyzing problems; for example, the aging patience and loving scrutiny of a protective parent. It could then be suggested that, among the common elements of a person's personality, the child is among the most prevalent.</p>
        <p>The most "childish" element of our psyche is the one which persists despite all our growing up. It often contains some troublesome traits which, either successfully or not, we have been raised to accept, change, or overcome. Personally, this would be my impulsivity (when it comes to self-gratification) and habit of quickly dropping one thing in favor of another. For many of us, this element intersects heavily with the hedonistic mechanisms in our brain. For example: impulsivity, discipline, pleasure-seeking, hedonism, over-indulgence. However, that is not to say that the childish element does not have some positive attributes. It  may contain windows into the truest form of ourself--that which persisted since a young age with a feeling of inseperability from one's authentic self. It may also contain fundamental characteristics of one's personality, such as their willingness to give to others, ability to tell a good joke, or habit of hugging their loved ones.</p>
        <p>When a "thing" is ran past the element of the child, it will give results which result its attributes. For example, if one was offered a nostalgic treat, the child would accept. When asked how many, the child would say "as many as possible". When asked how long to play a game, the child says "as long as possible". That is to say that the reactions and decisions of the child are often childish--lacking logic or restraint. </p>
        <p>The childish element may also contain many childish associations. These are things (most often products, entertainment, or activities) which we attatch to our childish self. There may also be some things in our current life which invoke these childish associations, such as watching certain shows, playing certain games, or consuming a certain product</p>
        <p>Importantly, the element of the child would also logically include those biological processes which we may attribute to "childishness". For the purposes of this discussion, that would notably include things such as a child's fixation on things which are flashing, bright, overembelished, friendly, cartoon, etc. (ADD MORE HERE ON THES TOPICS)</p>
